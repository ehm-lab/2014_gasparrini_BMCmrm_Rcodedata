Gasparrini A, Leone M. Attributable risk from distributed lag models. *BMC Medical Research Methodology*. 2014;**14**(1):55. [[freely available here](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2014_gasparrini_bmcmrm.html)]

This methodological article describes how to compute attributable risk measures from distributed lag linear and non-linear models, using functions in the [R package dlnm](https://github.com/gasparrini/dlnm) and the additional `attrdl()` function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code:

-   *london.csv* stores the dataset used in the illustrative examples
-   the numbered files from *01.runmodel.R* to *02.graphs.R* reproduce the results of the illustrative example
-   *attrdl.R* creates the function for computing the attributable risk measures
-   *attrdl.Rd* is the R documentation file to produce the help page *attrdl.pdf* for the function `attrdl()`
